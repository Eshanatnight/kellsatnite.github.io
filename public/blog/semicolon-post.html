				<h2 id="sub-heading">Inspiration</h2>
				<p>
					A few months ago I felt, Hey I am getting bored, I want make
					something, something cool. And started thining about what I
					could do. I have always been curious about Compilers, how
					they work. I had some basic knowledge about compilers, from
					my Compiler Design Class from my 3rd Year in college, and
					even went on to design a basic stack based programming
					language. But never did anything that could have been called
					an actual programming language.
				</p>

				<h2 id="sub-heading">First Thoughts</h2>
				<p>
					After I made up mind on making a programming language and
					obviously an interpreter for it, I started to think how I am
					going to do it, at this point I had decided that this
					programming language will be Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
					based. Of course I can not just create a parser and for ever
					possible instruction, I convert it to it’s corresponding
					Assembly and then assemble it, that would be far too “Brute
					Force” in nature. So, I decided I would use LLVM and it
					compiler frontend architecture.
				</p>

				<h2 id="sub-heading">Defining the Grammar</h2>
				<p>
					I wanted the Syntax and the grammar to be simple
					Python-like. So something like this.
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code class="language-python">1 + 2;
def foo(x y) x + y;
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h2 id="sub-heading">Implementing the Lexer</h2>
				<p>
					Now with the grammar defined I went on to start the
					implementation. I started with the Lexer, I had never
					written a Lexer before, so I started with the simplest thing
					I could think of, Define the tokens using an enum. Each
					token returned by our lexer will either be one of the
					<code>Token</code> <code>enum</code> values or it will be an
					‘unknown’ character like <code>+</code>, which is returned
					as its ASCII value.
				</p>
				<p>
					If the current token is an <code>identifier</code>, the
					<code>IdentifierStr</code> variable holds the name of the
					<em><strong>identifier</strong></em
					>. If the current token is a numeric literal (like 1.0),
					<code>NumVal</code> holds its value.
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code class="language-c">
enum Token {
  tok_eof = -1,
  tok_def = -2,
  tok_extern = -3,
  tok_identifier = -4,
  tok_number = -5,
  tok_if = -6,
  tok_then = -7,
  tok_else = -8,
  tok_for = -9,
  tok_in = -10,
  tok_binary = -11,
  tok_unary = -12,
  tok_var = -13
};            
					</code>
				</pre>
				<p>
					The actual implementation of the lexer is a single function
					named <code>gettok</code>. The gettok function is called to
					return the next token from standard input. The
					implementation looks something like this
				</p>
				<pre>
					<code class="language-c">
int gettok() {
  int LastChar = &#39; &#39;;
  // Skip any whitespace.
  //....
  // identifier: [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*
  if (isalpha(LastChar)) { 
	IdentifierStr = LastChar;
	while (isalnum((LastChar = getchar())))
	  IdentifierStr += LastChar;
	  // match the token to the identifier
	  //...
  }
  // get the number in a string, then parse it into a double
  if (isdigit(LastChar) || LastChar == &#39;.&#39;) { 
	//...
	return tok_number;
  }
  // Comment until end of line.
  if (LastChar == &#39;#&#39;) {
	//...
	if (LastChar != EOF)
	  return gettok();
  }
  // Check for end of file.  Don&#39;t eat the EOF.
  //..
  // Otherwise, just return the character as its ascii value.
  int ThisChar = LastChar;
  LastChar = getchar();
  return ThisChar;
}         
					</code>
				</pre>

				<h2 id="sub-heading">To Be Continued...</h2>
				<p>
					Its getting pretty long, so how about we continue this with
					the next post. Hope to see you all there.
